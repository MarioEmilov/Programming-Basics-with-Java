The course started in february 2021 and it was two months.
After this I was able to do: 
1. Work with the console - input and output
2. Make simple calculations
3. Work with conditions - if-else 
4. Work with more logical checks
5. Work with loops (for)
6. Work with more complex loops (nested loops and while loops)
