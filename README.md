The course started in february 2021 and it was two months.
After this I was able to do: 
1. Work with the console - input and output
2. Make simple calculations
3. Work with conditions - if-else 
4. Work with more logical checks
5. Work with loops (for)
6. Work with more complex loops (nested loops and while loops)

After that I received this Certificate:
[Programming Basics - February 2021 - Certificate.pdf](https://github.com/MarioEmilov/Programming-Basics-with-Java/files/6991744/Programming.Basics.-.February.2021.-.Certificate.pdf)
Nothing special.
